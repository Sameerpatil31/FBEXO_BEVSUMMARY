sold and liabilities settled.

2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):**
- Future Cash Flows: Estimated to sum to $1,350,000 over the next three years, assuming growth and discounting.
- Discount Rate: 8.05%
- Present Value: $1,144,155
- Explanation: The business is valued at $1,144,155 based on the present value of projected future cash flows.

3. **Comparable Company Analysis (CCA):**
- Average P/E Ratio of Comparable Firms: 57.63
- Net Profit: $200,000 (first year), $250,000 (second year), $300,000 (third year)
- Valuation: $11,326,000
- Explanation: The CCA valuation is $11,326,000, reflecting the business's worth based on the average price-to-earnings
ratio of similar companies.

4. **Rule of Thumb Methods:**
- Industry Multiplier: 5.20
- Gross Revenue: $1,200,000 (average of $1,000,000, $1,200,000, $1,350,000)
- Valuation: $6,240,000
- Explanation: This method provides a valuation of $6,240,000 by applying an industry-specific multiplier to gross
revenue.

5. **Earnings Multiplier:**
- Earnings Multiplier: 16.62
- Net Profit: $200,000 (first year), $250,000 (second year), $300,000 (third year)

and earnings potential.

6. **Liquidation Value:**
- Total Asset Liquidation Value: $300,000
- Liabilities: $150,000
- Liquidation Value: $150,000
- Explanation: The liquidation value is $150,000, representing the estimated proceeds if all assets were liquidated and
liabilities paid.

7. **Monte Carlo Simulation Results:**
- Mid-Range Valuation: $2,444,155
- High-Range Valuation: $3,444,155
- Explanation: The Monte Carlo simulation suggests that the businessâ€™s valuation could range between $2,444,155 and
$3,444,155, capturing a spectrum of potential outcomes.

**Valuation Summary:**
The business's valuation varies significantly based on the methodology applied:
